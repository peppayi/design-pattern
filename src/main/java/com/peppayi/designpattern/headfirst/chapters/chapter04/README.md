# The Factory Pattern

The Simple Factory isn't actually a Design Pattern; it's more of a programming idiom.

> The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating
> an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
> Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
